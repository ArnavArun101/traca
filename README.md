---

## 🚀 Overview

Traca.ai is a split-view web platform featuring dashboard panels alongside a conversational AI analyst. It provides:
- **Instant Market Intelligence:** Plain-language explanations of price movements and technical patterns.
- **Behavioural Coaching:** Detection of emotional or impulsive trading patterns (FOMO, revenge trading) with timely nudges.
- **Social Automation:** Autonomous AI personas that generate and draft market updates for LinkedIn and X.

## ✨ Core Features (MVP)

- **Real-time Market Insights:** Integration with Deriv API across Forex, Crypto, and Stock markets.
- **Conversational AI:** Unified chat handling market queries, behavioural feedback, and social content creation in one place.
- **Split-View Dashboard:** Side-by-side view of live price charts, sentiment gauges, and the AI analyst chat.
- **Behavioural Pattern Detection:** Identification of win/loss streaks and risk escalation with habit-building reinforcement.
- **Social Content Drafting:** Platform-appropriate content generation (Professional for LinkedIn, concise for X).

## 🏗️ Architecture

Traca.ai uses a **Modular Monolith** architecture optimized for real-time data flow and AI inference:

- **Frontend:** React (Vite) + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui + Zustand.
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) + Uvicorn + WebSockets.
- **AI Engine:** Local LLM inference via **Ollama** (Llama 3.3 / Mistral).
- **Data Source:** Deriv API for real-time pricing and trade history.
- **Persistence:** SQLite for trade history, session-based chat memory, and content drafts.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| **Backend** | FastAPI, Uvicorn, websockets, deriv_api, pandas-ta |
| **Frontend** | React 19, Vite, TanStack Query, Zustand, Recharts, Lightweight Charts |
| **AI/ML** | Ollama (Llama 3.3), Pydantic v2 |
| **Styling** | TailwindCSS 4, shadcn/ui |

## 🚦 Quickstart

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js & npm
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed and running
- [Deriv API Token](https://api.deriv.com/)

### 1. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Set DERIV_API_TOKEN in .env
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 2. LLM Setup
```bash
ollama pull llama3.3
ollama serve
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## ⚠️ Key Pitfalls & Prevention

- **API Rate Limits:** Deriv API has rate limits; subscription model and error handling are managed to avoid being blocked.
- **LLM Hallucinations:** Numbers are parsed programmatically from Deriv API; the LLM is used only for narrative explanation.
- **Render Performance:** High-frequency price updates are managed via Zustand to avoid React Context re-render storms.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Persistent cross-session AI memory.
- [ ] Multi-modal input (Analyze chart screenshots).
- [ ] Automated regulatory compliance filters for social posts.
- [ ] Mobile-native responsive application.
